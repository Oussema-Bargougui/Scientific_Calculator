# Scientific_Calculator
During my internship at CognoRise Infotech, I created a scientific calculator with Java Swing. I designed the UI with buttons for digits, arithmetic, and scientific functions, and implemented event handling for real-time feedback. This project highlighted my ability to integrate UI design with functional programming.
